### ðŸ¦„ Hi there, I'm Niko! ðŸš€

This is my profile, please feel free to take a look around. Somethings things that I've written
and you may find interesting:

| Repository | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [simple-private-vpc-template](https://github.com/niko-dunixi/simple-private-vpc-template) | IaC, written in GoLang, to stand up a low-cost AWS VPC that is simple enough for most of (my) use-cases and easy to create and destroy. Can be easily extended, but already has most of what you need. |
| [golang-simple-ingestion-pipeline-template](https://github.com/niko-dunixi/golang-simple-ingestion-pipeline-template) | A staple in distributed systems, an example of a low cost Lambda/SQS/Fargate application that can be deployed to AWS or developed locally |
| [git-openssl-shellscript](https://github.com/niko-dunixi/git-openssl-shellscript) | A script I wrote over 8 years ago that recompiles Git with OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS. I have no idea why it got so popular, but it has the most Stars and Forks of any project I've written. ðŸ˜‚ |
